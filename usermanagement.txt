user management in linux
1.How to Add a New User in Linux
 useradd username
 ex. useradd bharathi
When we add a new user in Linux with ‘useradd‘ command it gets created in locked state and to unlock that user account, 
we need to set a password for that account with ‘passwd‘ command.
2.passwd bharathi
  give passwd
Once a new user created, it’s entry automatically added to the ‘/etc/passwd‘ file. 
The file is used to store users information and the entry should be.
3.vi /etc/passwd to give all user information
4.Create a User with Different Home Directory
    useradd -d /data/projects anusha
    here we are giving -d option
5.Add a User to Multiple Groups
   useradd -G admins,webadmin,developers bharathi
6. /etc/passwd – User account information.
7./etc/shadow – Secure account information.
8./etc/group – Group account information.
9./etc/gshadow – Secure group account information.
10./etc/login.defs – Shadow password suite configuration

Group primary and secondary
1.usermod -g sales bharathi-----to modify primary group of the user
2.usermod -G  sales bharathi-----to modify secondary group of the user
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to delete users and groups
 userdel username
 userdel bharathi
 groupdel sales
--------------------------------------------------------------------
groupmod -n sales aws----to change the group name

sudoers
The sudoers file is a file Linux and Unix administrators use to allocate system rights to system user
# /etc/sudoers
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#

Defaults    env_reset

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command after they have
# provided their password
# (Note that later entries override this, so you might need to move
# it further down)
%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
#
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges

Run Levels in Linux
Prerequisite : Linux Booting
A run level is a state of init and the whole system that defines what system services are operating. Run levels are identified by numbers
Some system administrators use run levels to define which subsystems are working,
 e.g., whether X is running, whether the network is operational, and so on.
The important thing to note here is that there are differences in the runlevels according to the operating system
The standard LINUX kernel supports these seven different runlevels 
0 – System halt i.e the system can be safely powered off with no activity.
1 – Single user mode.
2 – Multiple user mode with no NFS(network file system).
3 – Multiple user mode under the command line interface and not under the graphical user interface.
4 – User-definable.
5 – Multiple user mode under GUI (graphical user interface) and this is the standard runlevel for most of the LINUX based systems.
6 – Reboot which is used to restart the system.

Attributes ( chattr and lsattr )---------to give security to the files or directories
Following are the list of common attributes and associated flags can be set/unset using the chattr command.
A file is set with ‘a‘ attribute, can only be open in append mode for writing.
A file is set with ‘i‘ attribute, cannot be modified (immutable). Means no renaming, no symbolic link creation, no execution, no writable, only superuser can unset the attribute.
A file with the ‘j‘ attribute is set, all of its information updated to the ext3 journal before being updated to the file itself.
A file is set with ‘t‘ attribute, no tail-merging.
A file with the attribute ‘d‘, will no more candidate for backup when the dump process is run.
When a file has ‘u‘ attribute is deleted, its data are saved. This enables the user to ask for its undeletion
Operator
+ : Adds the attribute to the existing attribute of the files.
– : Removes the attribute to the existing attribute of the files.
= : Keep the existing attributes that the files have.

touch demo.txt
chattr +i demo.txt------apply the command for chattr
Note: The immutable bit +i can only be set by superuser (i.e root) user or a user with sudo privileges can able to set.
After setting immutable bit, let’s verify the attribute with command ‘lsattr‘.
Now, tried to delete forcefully, rename or change the permissions, but it won’t allowed says “Operation not permitted“.
rm -rf demo.txt
 Operation not permitted
lsattr---to show the attributes apply or not
chattr -i demo.txt------to remove attributes
